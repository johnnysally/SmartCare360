## Deploy frontend to Netlify

1. In your Netlify dashboard, create a new site and connect your Git repository.
2. In Site settings -> Build & deploy -> Environment, add an environment variable:
	- `VITE_API_URL` = `https://smartcare360-jyho.onrender.com` (or your backend URL)
3. Netlify build settings (auto-detected from `netlify.toml`):
	- Build command: `npm run build`
	- Publish directory: `dist`
4. (Optional) Use the `public/_redirects` or `netlify.toml` redirects to enable client-side routing.

After deploy, open the site URL provided by Netlify. If you see stale assets, try clearing the cache or redeploy.
